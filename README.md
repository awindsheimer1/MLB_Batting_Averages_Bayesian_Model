# bayesian_baseball
From start to finish, I produced a bayesian hierarchical model for the prediction of MLB batting averages with respect to two distinct groups: batters and pitchers. 
I was given data from the first half of the season, and needed to predict the second-half batting averages for the players. I used normal priors and my knowledge of 
the game of baseball to define a logical approach to generating predictions, and the result was shown to be better than that of a straightforward frequentist method.
